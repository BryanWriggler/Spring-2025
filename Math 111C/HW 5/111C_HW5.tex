    \begin{question}
        Let $F$ be a finite field. Prove that $|F|=p^n$ for some prime $p$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
    \end{question}
\end{myBox}

\textbf{Pf:}

Since $F$ is a finite field, then $\textmd{char}(F)=p$ for some prime $p$. It suffices to show that $|F|=p^n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

Suppose the contrary that the above statement doesn't hold, then there exists some distinct prime number $q\neq p$, such that $q$ divides $|F|$. Recall that $F$ is a finite abelian group under addition, hence \textbf{Cauchy's Theorem} applies, there exists $a\in F$, such that its order with respect to addition (denoted as $\textmd{order}(a)$) is $q$.

However, since $p,q$ are distinct primes, then by \textbf{Bezout's Lemma}, there exists $s,t\in\mathbb{Z}$, with $sp+tq = 1$. Then, let $n\cdot a$ denotes the addition of $a$ total of $n$ times (if $n$ is negative, do the addition of $-a$ total of $|n|$ times instead) and let $1_p$ denote the identity of $F$, then we get the following:
$$a = (sp+tq)\cdot a = (s\cdot (p\cdot 1_p))\cdot a + t(q\cdot a) = (s\cdot 0)\cdot a + t\cdot 0 = 0$$
Which shows that $a=0$. But, if $a=0$, then $\textmd{order}(a)=1$, which contradicts the statement that $\textmd{order}(a)=q>1$. 

So, our assumption is false, $|F|=p^n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

    \begin{question}
        Show that $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^3+x+1)\cong \mathbb{F}_2[y]/(y^3+y^2+1)$ and find an explicit isomorphism.
    \end{question}
\end{myBox}

\textbf{Pf:}

Let $K_1=\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^3+x+1)$, and $K_2=\mathbb{F}_2[y]/(y^3+y^2+1)$. Which, since the extensions are based on two degree $3$ polynomial, then $[K_1:\mathbb{F}_2]=[K_2:\mathbb{F}_2]=3$, which implies that $|K_1| = |K_2| = 2^3=8$.

Now, consider $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2$: Since both $K_1,K_2$ are finite extensions of $\mathbb{F}_2$, they're algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{F}_2$. Hence, there exists embeddings $\phi_1:K_1\rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{F}}_2$ and $\phi_2:K_2\rightarrow\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2$.

Now, since $\phi_1(K_1)\cong K_1$ and $\phi_2(K_2)\cong K_2$, then $|\phi_1(K_1)|=|K_1|=8=|K_2|=|\phi_2(K_2)|$. Then, since $8=2^3$, under $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2$, there exists a unique finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^3}\subset\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2$ with order $|\mathbb{F}_{2^3}|=2^3$. Hence, this enforces $\phi_1(K_1)=\phi_2(K_2)=\mathbb{F}_{2^3}$.

So, after restriction, we get the following relationships of isomorphisms:
$$\phi_1:K_1\ \tilde{\rightarrow}\ \mathbb{F}_{2^3},\quad \phi_2:K_2\ \tilde{\rightarrow}\ \mathbb{F}_{2^3}$$
Hence, $\phi_2^{-1}\circ \phi_1:K_1\rightarrow K_2$ is an isomorphism, showing that $K_1\cong K_2$.

\hfil

\textbf{Construction of Isomorphism:}

Now, consider the element $(y+1)\in \mathbb{F}_2[y]$, it satisfies the following:
$$(y+1)^3+(y+1)+1 = (y+1)(y+1)^2+(y+1)+1 = (y+1)(y^2+1^2)+(y+1)\cdot 1+1$$
$$ = (y+1)(y^2+1+1)+1 = (y+1)y^2 + 1 = y^3+y^2+1$$
So, this implies that $(\overline{y+1})^3+\overline{y+1}+1 = \overline{y^3+y^2+1}= 0$ in $K_2$.

Hence, consider the ring isomorphism by $\phi:\mathbb{F}_2[x]\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_2[y]$ by $\phi(x)=(y+1)$, the maximal ideal $(x^3+x+1)\subset \mathbb{F}_2[x]$ has its image $\phi((x^3+x+1)) = ((y+1)^3+(y+1)+1) = (y^3+y^2+1)$, hence if take the projection $\pi_y:\mathbb{F}_2[y]\rightarrow K_2$ by $\pi_y(p(y))=\overline{p(y)}=p(y)\mod\ (y^3+y^2+1)$, the composition $\pi_y\circ\phi:\mathbb{F}_2[x]\rightarrow K_2$ becomes a ring homomorphism where the kernel is valid.

Which, since $\phi(x^3+x+1)=(y+1)^3+(y+1)+1 = y^3+y^2+1$, then $\pi_y\circ\phi(x^3+x+1)=\overline{y^3+y^2+1}=0$, hence $x^3+x+1\in \ker(\pi\circ\phi)$, or $(x^3+x+1)\subseteq \ker(\pi\circ\phi)$. Then, by \textbf{Generalized First Isomorphism Theorem}, there exists unique well-defined ring homomorphism $\overline{\phi}:\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^3+x+1)\rightarrow K_2$, such that with the projection $\pi_x:\mathbb{F}_2[x]\rightarrow K_1$ by $\pi(p(x))=\overline{p(x)}=p(x)\mod\ (x^3+x+1)$, the following diagram commutes:

\textbf{Insert commutative diagram}

Or, $\overline{\phi}\circ \pi_x = \pi_y\circ \phi$.

Then, since $\pi_y\circ\phi$ is surjective (since both $\pi_y$ and $\phi$ are surjective), while $\pi_x$ is surjective, then in case for $\overline{\phi}\circ \pi_x$ to be surjective, $\overline{\phi}$ is surjective. On the other hand, since $\overline{\phi}:K_1\rightarrow K_2$ with $K_1$ being a field, this map is injective. 

So, $\overline{\phi}$ is a well-defined isomorphism between $K_1$ and $K_2$, with the following formula:
$$\overline{\phi}(1)=1,\quad \overline{\phi}(\overline{x}) = \overline{y+1}\in K_2$$

    \begin{question}
        Let $F$ be a perfect field with $\textmd{char}(F)=p$. Prove that $F=F^p$.
    \end{question}
\end{myBox}

\textbf{Pf:}

We'll prove by contradiction. Suppose $F$ is a perfect field, while $F\neq F^p$, then since $F^p\subsetneq F$, there exists $\alpha\in F\setminus F^p$, which implis that for all $\beta\in F$, $\beta^p\neq \alpha$.

So, the polynomial $x^p-\alpha \in F[x]$ has no solution in $F$, which based on \textbf{HW 2 Question 3}, this polynomial is in fact irreducible in $F[x]$.

\hfil

Now, consider $K=F[x]/(x^p-\alpha)$ a finite extension, and take $\theta=\overline{x}\in K$: since it satisfies $\overline{x}^p-\alpha = \overline{(x^p-\alpha)}=0$, then $\overline{x}^p=\alpha$, and $\theta = \overline{x}$ is a root of the monic polynomial $x^p-\alpha\in F[x]\subset K[x]$; also, since $x^p-\alpha$ is proven to be irreducible, then $m_{\theta,F}(x)=x^p-\alpha$.

But, because $\textmd{char}(F)=p$, then $\textmd{char}(K)=p$, which $\textmd{char}(K[x])=p$. So, based on Frobenius Endomorphism, $(x-\theta)^p = x^p-\theta^p$, showing that $(x-\theta)^p$ is a factorization of $x^p-\alpha$ in $K[x]$; then, since $K[x]$ is a UFD, such factorization is unique. Hence, $m_{\theta,F}(x) = (x-\theta)^p$, showing that the minimal polynomial of $\theta$ over $F$ has $\theta$ as a root with multiplicity $p>1$, so $\theta\in K$ is not separable over $F$, or $K/F$ is not a separable extension.

Yet, recall that $F$ is assumed to be a perfect field, while $K/F$ is a finite extension, then $K/F$ should be a separable extension by the definition of perfect field. So, we reach a contradiction, therefore the initial assumption is false, if $F$ is a perfect field, then $F=F^p$.

\section*{4 (infinite case not done)}
\begin{myBox}[]{}
    \begin{question}
        Show that an algebraic extension of a perfect field is perfect.
    \end{question}
\end{myBox}

\textbf{Pf:}

Suppose $F$ is a perfect field, then all finite extension is a separable extension. Which, for any algebraic extension $K/F$, there are two cases to consider:

\hfil

\textbf{1. When $K$ is a finite extension:}

Given any finite extension $K/F$, and consider any finite extension $L/K$" Since both extensions are finite (with $F\subseteq K\subseteq L$), then $L/F$ is also a finite extension. Based on the assumption that $F$ is perfect, $L/F$ is a separable extension.

Which, for all $\alpha\in L$, its minimal polynomial $m_{\alpha,F}(x)\in F[x]$ must have simple roots in $\overline{F}$.

\hfil

Since $L/F$ is a finite extension, then it is also algebraic, hence there exists embedding $\phi:L\rightarrow\overline{F}$ that fixes $F$, which can be extended to an injective ring homomorphism $\overline{\phi}:L[x]\rightarrow\overline{F}[x]$, by the following:
$$\forall a_n,...,a_0\in L,\quad \overline{\phi}(a_nx^n+...+a_0)=\phi(a_n)x^n+...+\phi(a_0)$$
(Note: it is injective, since if the output is $0$, then each coefficient $a_i$ must satisfy $\phi(a_i)=0$, and since $\phi$ is a field embedding, it is injective, so each $a_i=0$, showing the input is $0$).

Now, since $\alpha\in L$ is a root of $m_{\alpha,F}(x)\in F[x]\subseteq L[x]$, then let $k\in\mathbb{N}$ be the multiplicity of $\alpha$ as a root of $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$, we get $(x-\alpha)^k\mid m_{\alpha,F}(x)$, or $m_{\alpha,F}(x)=(x-\alpha)^kq(x)$ for some $q(x)\in L[x]$. Then, since $m_{\alpha,F}(x)\in F[x]$, we know $\overline{\phi}(m_{\alpha,F}(x)) = m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ (since $\phi$ fixes $F$, $\overline{\phi}$ also fixes $F$. Apply the extended ring homomorphism, we get:
$$m_{\alpha,F}(x)=\overline{\phi}(m_{\alpha,F}(x))=\overline{\phi}((x-\alpha)^kq(x)) = (x-\phi(\alpha))^k\overline{\phi}(q(x))\in \overline{F}[x]$$
This shows that $\phi(\alpha)$ is a root of $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ in $\overline{F}$ with multiplicity $\geq k$. Then, because $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ has simple roots in $\overline{F}$, $\phi(\alpha)$ as a root must have multiplicity of $1$, hence $k\leq 1$. This implies that $k=1$, which $\alpha$ as a root of $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ must have multiplicity $1$.

\hfil

Finally, since $\alpha$ is also algebraic over $K$ (since $L/K$ are finite extensions), then $m_{\alpha, K}(x)\in K[x]$ exists; and since $m_{\alpha,F}(x)\in F[x]\subseteq K[x]$, then $m_{\alpha,K}(x)\mid m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ in $K[x]$.

Because $\alpha$ is a root of $m_{\alpha,K}(x)$, let $l\in \mathbb{N}$ be its multiplicity, we get $(x-\alpha)^l\mid m_{\alpha,K}(x)$ in $L[x]$;also, since $m_{\alpha,K}(x)\mid m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ in $K[x]\subseteq L[x]$, this implies $(x-\alpha)^l\mid m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ in $L[x]$. Hence, since $\alpha$ is proven to be a root of $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ with multiplicity $1$, this implies that $l\leq 1$, or $l=1$.

So, $\alpha$ as a root of $m_{\alpha,K}(x)$ has multiplicity $1$, and since $m_{\alpha,K}(x)$ is irreducible in $K[x]$, all its root in $\overline{K}$ must have the same multiplicity. Which, they must all have multiplicity $1$ (or being a simple root), showing that $\alpha$ is actually separable over $K$.

This shows that $L/K$ is in fact a separable extension, which proves that $K$ is also perfect. So, all finite extension $K/F$ is also perfect.
