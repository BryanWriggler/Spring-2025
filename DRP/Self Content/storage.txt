    \block{Smooth Manifold \& Smooth Functions}{
        Given a topological space $M$ of dimension $n$, it's a manifold if it locally looks like $\mathbb{R}^n$: More precisely, for each $m\in M$, there exists an open neighborhood $U\subseteq M$ that is homeomorphic to some open set $\tilde{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. Together, such pair $(U,\phi)$ is called a \textbf{Chart}, and collection of all charts of $M$ is called an \textbf{Atlas}.

        A manifold $M$ has a smooth structure, if any two charts can be composed into a smooth map. Or, given two charts $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\varphi)$ with $U\cap V\neq \emptyset$, when restricting to $\phi(U\cap V)s\subseteq \tilde{U}$ and $\varphi(U\cap V)\subseteq \tilde{V}$, the map $$\varphi\circ \phi^{-1}:\phi(U\cap V)\rightarrow \varphi(U\cap V)$$
        is a smooth map between open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

        A function $F:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is smooth, if for any smooth chart $(U,\phi)$, the composition 
        $$f\circ \phi^{-1}:\phi(U)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$
        is a smooth map. A collection of smooth functions on $M$ is denoted as $C^\infty(M)$.

    Some parts about geometric tangent space:
    %Delete everything about geometric tangent space (just a small intuition)
        %In simplest case, if embedd manifold $M^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$, for any chart $(U,\phi)$ of $M$, since $\phi:U\rightarrow\phi(U)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ has its inverse $\phi^{-1}$ being smooth, for any $u\in U\subseteq M$, a tangent vector $v_u$ associates with vector $v\in\mathbb{R}^n$, is characterized by differential of $\phi^{-1}$:
        %$$v_u := D\phi^{-1}(\phi(u))(v) = \lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\phi^{-1}(\phi(u)+tv)-\phi^{-1}(\phi(u))}{t}$$
        %A collection of all such vector is the \textbf{Geometric Tangent Space} of $u$, denoted as $T_u(M)$.

        %Notice that for any smooth function $f\in C^\infty(M)$, it has a notion of directional derivative at $u$ depending on the tangent vector $v_u\in T_u(M)$, and such derivative satisfies genral differentiation rules (for instance, product rule).
