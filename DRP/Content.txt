Intro: Mention some brief history of lie groups / lie algebra

Basic Terminology:
    * Smooth Manifold: a manifold with an extra condition of having the charts being Smooth
    * Smooth map: map between smooth manifolds, such that when composing with the charts, it forms a smooth map between R^n
    * Group: A set along with a binary operation, such that it satisfies associativity, existence of identity, and existence of inverse
    * Tangent Space & Tangent Vector: Introducing derivations?

    Potential:
    * Diffeomorphism, tangent space, differential, etc.

Definition of Lie Group:
* A smooth manifold that's also a group, along with the fact that the group operation and the inverse maps are smooth
* In particular, any left / right multiplication is a smooth map (diffeomorphism)

Definition of Vector Fields:
* a map X:M->TM (the tangent bundle), such that X is a smooth map
* more concisely, for each x in X, associate a unique tangent vector in T_xX to x.

Definition of Lie Bracket:
* [X,Y]=XY-YX, which for any smooth function 




Note: Potentially need to focus on either lie group or lie algebra (covering both is too much)
